New version 2.95.  

The main programs are pretty vanilla C++, but there are also a bunch
of C-shell scripts.  The system is known to work on Linux and should
work on any *nix system (BSD, Solaris, etc.) with minimal tweaking.
The main programs used to run under Windows, compiled with OpenWatcom
(www.openwatcom.org), but that hasn't been tested for a while; you'll
also need Cygwin if you want to run any training or tuning under
Windows (all data files are architecture independent, so you can
train a system under Linux and then just copy everything but the
executables over to Windows).

CHANGES SINCE 11/2009 RELEASE:

Added parameter tuner.

Revamped scoring to use an explicit feature vector rather than a
series of member variables, which makes it much easier to add new
features.  Added a bunch of new features to the log-linear model.

Removed a bunch of obsolete code and settings.

This release is all in one archive, and includes a sample translation
system for English to Haitian Creole, with instructions for building
the corresponding Haitian Creole to English system.
